# open-test
This is the test project testing various strategies for open source project

Things to do
1. figure out the permission problem at local machine
2. figure the easier mechanism to push the code
3. linking issues, project / features, project, Wiki etc

Notes:
1. While creating repository, I have created empty repository without even readme file. At that point, I was not able to upload or create new file using github webportal. The edit button appears against a file while upload button appears when there is at least a file. But to my sorrows, I was not having any file in the repository!!! ;(. As I was also struggling with permissions while committing, I was left with only option to import the code from other repository. So that's that.
